online-anonymity
================

Many people take their online privacy very seriously, concerned about who may be spying on them and reading their data. Some internet users turn to the TOR network.

Research and briefly describe what the TOR network is and how it works. (2 marks)

```
The TOR network allows users to anonymously browse the web keeping their identities hidden from other people using the web.
TOR is a completely free program that anybody can download and use, but TOR can be used for bad habits and a lot of people use it to access the dark side of the internet where anything can be bought anything can be done without people knowing where you are and who you are.
TOR (The onion router) is named because of the layers of encryption they have when users use it and it uses many relays to encrypt the data, so the user can remain anonymous.

```
A lot of bad people will use TOR so they can buy illegal things, get illegal images, and so they can talk to others in private. A lot of paedophiles use the dark net to use private chat rooms where they can send and recieve illegal images and since they cannot be tracked down they don't have to worry about being caught because of the service TOR provides.
